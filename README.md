## Idea
Basically my friend and I are searching for the best Taxi Driver AI in GTA V.
For this we chose the hardest road there is on the map for the drivers to drive on.

The startpoint is at the end of the street.

IF a Taxi Driver is able to make it to the finish line, the road will be driven backwards with the same driver.
